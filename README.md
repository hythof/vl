# The Programming Language
Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

## Simple language
- Values: number, string, bool, function
- Containers: array, struct, dictionary
- Function: definition, call, closure
- Types: struct, enum, interface, generics
- Statement: sequence, branch, loop, coroutine
- Error handling: nullable, failable, result
- Namespace

## Easy to use
- REPL
- Hot code reloading
- Cross compilation to Linux, Windows and Mac
- Dependency is only some Posix APIs

## Performance
- As fast as C based on LLVM
- No GC

## Safety
- No null
- No exception
- No shadowing
- No global variables
- No implicit type casting
- No undefined specification
- Array bounds checking
