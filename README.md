# The Programming Language
Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

## Simple language
- Values: number, string, bool, function
- Containers: array, struct, dictionary
- Function: define, call, closure
- Types: interface, generics, composition
- Control structures: do, if, for, next, break, return, throw, catch

## Easy
- REPL
- Hot code reloading
- Cross compilation to Linux, Windows and Mac
- Dependency is only some posix API

## Performance
- As fast as C based on LLVM
- No GC

## Safety
- No null
- No exception
- No global variables
- No shadowing
- No undefined specification
- Array bounds checking
- Generics type
